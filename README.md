# Project Title: Arduino IR Object Counter with LCD Display (I2C)

## Project Description

In this project, we will create a simple yet effective object counter using an Arduino, an IR (Infrared) sensor module, and an LCD display connected via an I2C module. This setup is ideal for counting objects passing through a specific point, such as on a conveyor belt or in a doorway. The counter will increment each time the IR sensor detects an object, and the count will be displayed on the LCD.

## Components Needed
- **Arduino Uno**
- **IR Sensor Module**
- **16x2 LCD Display with I2C Module**
- **Breadboard and Jumper Wires**
- **Resistor** (if necessary for the IR sensor)
- **Power Supply** (USB cable or external power source)

## How It Works
- **IR Sensor Module:** The IR sensor module consists of an IR LED and a photodiode. The IR LED emits infrared light, and when an object passes through the sensor, it interrupts the IR beam, causing a change in the signal received by the photodiode. This change in signal will be used to increment the counter.
- **Arduino Uno:** The Arduino Uno will read the signal from the IR sensor and increment a counter each time the signal changes (indicating an object passing through).
- **LCD Display (I2C):** The 16x2 LCD display will be connected to the Arduino via the I2C interface, which simplifies the wiring by using only two data lines (SDA and SCL). The display will show the current count of objects detected by the IR sensor.

This simple project is a great way to learn about integrating sensors with Arduino and displaying data on an LCD. It can be expanded or modified for various applications, such as automated inventory systems, people counters, or any scenario requiring object detection and counting.
